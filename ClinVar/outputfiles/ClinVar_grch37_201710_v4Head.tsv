(1990) found a variant allele of the CYP2A6 gene that has a single amino acid substitution (leu160 to his; L160H) and encodes an unstable and catalytically inactive enzyme. PCR-based diagnostic analysis of DNA from subjects that had been phenotyped for coumarin 7-hydroxylation verified that the variant-1 allele is unable to produce a catalytically active enzyme. Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) found a frequency of 15% for the variant-1 (v1) allele in Finns, with no alleles of the v2 (122720.0004) type. In African Americans, no examples of the CYP2A6 v1 allele was found among 40 alleles; the frequency of the v2 allele was 2.5%. Japanese had 20% v1 allele and 28% v2 allele. Taiwanese had 11% v1 allele, and 6% v2 allele. If both the v1 and v2 alleles encode a catalytically defective enzyme, the Japanese population would be predicted to have a frequency of up to 10% of poor metabolizers of coumarin (122700).||Hadidi et al. (1997) identified an individual who was homozygous for the L160H substitution. On administration of coumarin (2 mg orally), no detectable 7-hydroxycoumarin was excreted in the urine; rather, approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, the end product of coumarin 3-hydroxylation. His immediate family members who were heterozygous for the CYP2A6*2 allele excreted little 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and mainly 7-hydroxycoumarin, when similarly tested. The authors suggested that persons homozygous for the CYP2A6*2 allele may constitute 1 to 25% of various populations.||Oscarson et al. (1998) found that the commonly used method for CYP2A6 genotyping gave erroneous results with respect to the coumarin hydroxylase phenotype. They described an allele-specific PCR genotyping method that identified the major defective CYP2A6 allele and accurately predicted the phenotype. An allele frequency of 1 to 3% for CYP2A6*2 was observed in Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish populations, much lower than described previously. In a Chinese population, Oscarson et al. (1999) did not detect any CYP2A6*2 alleles, in contrast to the frequency of 11 to 20% previously reported by Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995).||Pianezza et al. (1998) demonstrated association of this allele, which confers impaired nicotine metabolism, with a reduction in risk of tobacco dependence (see 188890).||Following up on the report by Pianezza et al. (1998), London et al. (1999) examined the association between the presence of a single CYP2A6 reduced activity allele (L160H) and lower prevalence of smoking among 460 persons enrolled in a case-control study of lung cancer in Los Angeles County, California. Compared with subjects without a reduced activity allele, those with 2 reduced activity alleles were slightly overrepresented among those who had never smoked (p = 0.057). However, in contrast to the finding of Pianezza et al. (1998), participants with a single reduced activity allele were not less likely to smoke. Furthermore, London et al. (1999) found no evidence that the presence of reduced activity alleles decreased the usual number of cigarettes consumed per day by smokers.||Gu et al. (2000) used long PCR followed by nested PCR to determine 3 CYP2A6 alleles (160L, 160H, and O). Adopting an approach to association analysis originally developed to deal with null alleles implicit in ABO blood group phenotyping, they tested the contribution of 160H (functionally null) to reduced smoking habit, unconfounded by alleles null to the long PCR. The most significant findings (p less than 0.01) were that the possession of a 160H allele, compared with not possessing a 160H allele, was associated with a mean age of starting regular smoking 3 years later; and that the average likelihood of quitting smoking at any time is 1.75 times greater for those possessing a 160H allele compared with those who had no 160H allele. This suggested that a smoking subject with a genotype predicted to confer 50% of the ability to eliminate nicotine via the CYP2A6 pathway has almost twice the likelihood of quitting smoking.||This variant was designated CYP2A6*2 by the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Committee.

(2001) identified a child with neonatal-onset citrullinemia (605814) who was compound heterozygous for this mutation and an IVS11+1G-A mutation (603859.0002) in the SLC25A13 gene. The patient pursued a favorable clinical course, and all biochemical abnormalities normalized by the age of 12 months.||Tamamori et al. (2002) reported a patient with neonatal-onset citrullinemia who was compound heterozygous for the 4-bp deletion and IVS11+1G-A. She had an unusual disease course with a worsening of liver function at age 6 months, ultimately requiring a living-related liver transplant at 10 months of age. She had normal growth and mental development at age 3 years. Tamamori et al. (2002) noted that the same genotype had been identified in a patient with the usual course of spontaneous remission (Ohura et al., 2001), suggesting that the severe phenotype was not due to the genotype.||Kobayashi et al. (1999) found that 9 patients with adult-onset type II citrullinemia (603471) were homozygous for a 4-bp (GTAT) deletion from nucleotide 851 in exon 9, predicting a frameshift and introduction of a stop codon at position 286, leading to premature termination of the protein. Three other patients were heterozygous for the mutation.||not provided			CITRULLINEMIA, TYPE II, ADULT-ONSETCitrin Deficiency

The mutation disrupted residues conserved from chicken to human within the fifth transmembrane domain of the P2RY5 protein.||In affected members of 2 Pakistani families segregating an autosomal recessive hypotrichosis/woolly hair phenotype, Khan et al.
